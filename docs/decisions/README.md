# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Platform Commons.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## When to Write an ADR

Create an ADR when you make a decision that:
- Affects the structure or behavior of the system
- Is difficult or expensive to reverse
- Impacts multiple modules or teams
- Requires explanation for future maintainers

## ADR Format

Each ADR should include:

1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
3. **Date**: When the decision was made
4. **Deciders**: Who made the decision
5. **Context**: The problem and constraints
6. **Decision**: What was decided
7. **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes
8. **Alternatives**: Other options considered

## Naming Convention

ADRs are numbered sequentially:
```
000-template.md
001-platform-commons-library.md
002-next-decision.md
...
```

## How to Create a New ADR

1. Copy `000-template.md`
2. Rename with next number and descriptive title
3. Fill out all sections
4. Include in your PR
5. Update this index
